# Predecessor — Developer Hub

Green/black coding theme with Matrix-style background, animated logo, responsive hamburger menu, and multi-page layout (Home, Showcase, Download, Store, About Me).

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Upload all files to your repo (e.g. `predecessor.github.io`).
2. Ensure the repo is public and GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` → `/root`).
3. Replace image assets in `assets/img/` with your own, keeping filenames if you want drop-in replacements.
4. Edit links on `download.html` and items on `store.html`.
5. Optional: Replace the Formspree endpoint in `about.html`.

### Tips
- Press **M** to toggle the Matrix background performance-wise on low-end devices.
- Edit colors in `assets/css/styles.css` under `:root`.
- The service worker provides basic offline caching.
- The navigation highlights the active page automatically.
